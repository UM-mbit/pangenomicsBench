# Building GWFA
1. Ensure that the environment variable `VTUNE_HOME` points to the vtune
   directory (e.g. `export VTUNE_HOME=/opt/intel/oneapi/vtune/latest`).
2. Build the kernel with `make -j`

# Running GWFA
Run the kernel with the command
`./bin/gwfa <path to data> <num iterations, or blank>`
Example with `$KERNEL_DATA` pointing to the kernel data directory
`./bin/gwfa $KERNEL_DATA/Gwfa/McChm13 30`:

# Generating Input
Inputs were generated by running a hacked version of minigraph
(`https://github.com/kaplannp/minigraph/tree/serialization`) on chromosome 20
HPRC V1 pangenome graph with chromosome 20 chm13 assembly.
Please note that the raw inputs as generated from running the kernel do not
include the graph. You must move the graph there manually and title it
"graph.gfa"

# Understanding Output 
Each kernel output gets one line of the format:
```
<gfa_edrst_t.s> <gfa_edrst_t.wlen> { <nodeId> <nodeId> ... }
```

I include the first two terms so we can compare with true outputs and ensure we
didn't change anything, but I do not understand
their exact function. If I had to guess, wlen is some kind of character count,
but to really understand these terms you will need to dig through the minigraph
source. I found them difficult to understand.

The bracket term is the more important result anyways, it represents a path 
through the graph.
